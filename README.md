# -CIFAR-10-Object-Detection
CIFAR-10 is a popular image classification dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The 10 classes are airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.CIFAR-10 is a challenging dataset due to its small image size and the similarity between some of the classes. However, it is also a popular benchmark dataset for testing the performance of image classification models.

To work with CIFAR-10, you can use popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and train a binary classifier on the dataset using CNN layers for feature extraction or transformer modules with self-attention networks. You can use techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and regularization to improve the model's performance.
